# JavaFX-Adventure

## Overview
This project utilizes the JavaFX platform with the Scene Builder tool to construct a basic choose-your-own adventure style game.  The game consists of a series of encounters, in which the player is presented with multiple options.  The player can choose to attack, run away, or use support items to aid in combat.  The game has many different endings depending on the player's choices.  The player will continue to interact with the situations presented throughout the game until reaching one of these endings.

## NOTICE
This repo contains the set of files crucial to JavaFX and Scenebuilder [the sourcecode], but does not contain all files necessary to run the game in full. [base library not included]
